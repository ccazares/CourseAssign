   <h2>Chicken</h2>
      <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. In developed countries, chickens are usually subject to intensive farming methods. The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages. It was eaten over most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were eaten. It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar. Chicken consumption in the United States increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).</p>
   <h2>Beef</h2>
   <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world. People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle around 8000 BC to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather. Most cattle originated in the Old World, with the exception of bison hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include the Wagyū from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from Egypt, and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent. It is unknown exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World as draft animals (oxen), for milk, or specifically for human consumption. With the mechanization of farming, some breeds were specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and Charolais cattle, or to improve the texture of meat, giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and Wagyū. Some breeds have been selected for both meat and milk production, such as the Brown Swiss (Braunvieh). In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began, starting primarily with the taming of wild longhorn cattle.</p>
   <h2>Sushi</h2>
   <p>Es un plato de origen japonés basado en arroz cocido adobado con vinagre de arroz, azúcar, sal y otros ingredientes, como verduras, pescados o mariscos. Este plato es uno de los más reconocidos de la gastronomía japonesa y uno de los más populares internacionalmente. El nombre sushi se refiere a la preparación del arroz y que el acompañamiento, si bien es relevante en el sabor, no hace al plato en sí. Aunque existe una variedad de acompañamientos de sushi internacionalmente reconocidos y acostumbrados, lo ideal es que cada región adopte acompañamientos típicos del lugar con pescados o frutos de la región que estén identificados con el gusto y la gastronomía local. El nombre procede de las palabras japonesas 'su arroz, y shi vinagre de arroz; avinagrado).</p>
